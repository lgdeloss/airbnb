# Project: Write a data science blog post
## Libraries used
numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn

## Motivation for the project
This was an assignment from the udacity nanodegree for data science

## The files in the repository with a small description of each
testing.ipynb is the notebook where I did all of the work

## A summary of the results of the analysis
Results will show that there can be a lot of information deduced from the features.

## Necessary acknowledgments
Udacity nanodegree program and mentors

# Business Understanding
